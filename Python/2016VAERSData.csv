Which had never happened before. I then began feeling very fatigued. I remember sitting at work one night and all the sudden my brain felt very weird. It felt like I had a rubber band type of pressure around my head. I felt very uneasy. It lasted for approximately one week. And then my brain went into overdrive. It felt extremely weird. I couldn't breathe and it felt like I was going to pass out. My heart was racing and my brain had a very weird physical sensation to it. I had racing thoughts, and my blood felt like it was very excited. This lasted for a very long time. It never really went away. I felt very ill. All the time as well. It was a state of constant panic. The sensations moved around my body. Sometimes I would have throat symptoms, then stomach, loss of coordination, etc. I was in and out of the hospital constantly. They ran blood test after blood test, MRI, etc and said everything was normal. I had sensitivity to sound and other scary symptoms. It lasted every single day. I remember going to the hospital and could not stop shaking, it was not a seizure but almost felt like it. More like convulsions. I also dealt with severe fatigue and dizziness and at times difficulty breathing. The doctors attributed all of my symptoms to panic disorder. But the reason why I was having anxiety is because of the way I my body was feeling. I felt so extremely sick all of the time. It has been a little over two years now. My symptoms have gotten better but I still deal with stuff every day. I deal with fatigue, dizziness, sense of sickness that comes and goes. Prior to Gardasil I had never felt like this. Not once in my life. I was a happy go lucky guy that had a bright future ahead of myself. But now, my life is destroyed. I am always sick. It's not because of stress or anxiety. Its because my body feels sick all the time. It's physical. No doctor has been able to give me any answers. And its hard for me to believe this has been cause my anxiety. I lost everything because of this, my job, marriage, friends, etc. I sit in my house and deal with my symptoms. I've been on antidepressants and other drugs which never helped. I don't have any solid evidence if Gardasil caused this.

The author in the article discussed about acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients (less than or equal to 18 years) who were newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and were enrolled on an ALL treatment protocol (total therapy XVI) between Oct 2007 and May 2011 were evaluated. The total therapy XVI therapy consisted of a 6-week remission induction, 8-week consolidation and 120-week continuation phase that included two 3-week periods of more intensive chemotherapy (reinduction I and reinduction II). This report refers to an 11-month-old female patient. Past medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. The patient started therapy with cytarabine (manufacturer: not reported) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia at an unknown dose and route from an unknown date. The patient received palivizumab (manufacturer: not reported) for immunoprophylaxis at an unknown dose and route on an unknown date. The patient was vaccinated with two doses of seasonal influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) on unknown dates. It was reported that 10 days before developing illness, the patient had received palivizumab. Also it was reported that on an unknown date the patient received high dose of cytarabine for reinduction II chemotherapy. The patient was presented in the hospital with a 3-day history of progressively worsening cough, nasal congestion, fever, respiratory distress with profound neutropenia and lymphopenia for which the patient was hospitalized. Initial evaluation revealed the patient had bilateral peribronchial thickening and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected on a nasopharyngeal wash specimen by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Treatment was started with aerosolized ribavirin in addition to oxygen support and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, due to progressive respiratory deterioration and increasing fever, a chest x-ray was repeated on day 5 of hospitalization which demonstrated left lower lobe consolidation pneumonia suggestive of secondary bacterial infection. The patient's treatment regimen included vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole, palivizumab and aerosolized ribavirin. On day 28 of hospitalization, the patient experienced respiratory and hemodynamic failure which required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor followed by extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation support. The patient died 2 months after onset of the RSV infection. The outcome of events respiratory syncytial virus infection, respiratory failure, circulatory failure and pneumonia bacterial was fatal and outcome of events lymphopenia and neutropenia was not reported. Action taken with palivizumab and cytarabine was unknown. The author stated that despite the low incidence of viral ARI in children with ALL, the associated morbidity, mortality and delay in chemotherapy remain clinically significant. Viral lower respiratory tract infection was especially associated with high morbidity requiring intensive care-level support. The author concluded that in spite of current advances in ALL cure rates, molecular diagnostic techniques, antiviral therapies and active and passive immune prevention approaches, respiratory viral infections remain a significant burden in children with ALL.",Y,,,,Y,,,,N,,,,"Chest X-ray, Abnormal, Significant, Left lower lobe consolidation pneumonia suggestive of secondary bacterial infection; Polymerase chain reaction, Abnormal, Significant, Respiratory syncytial virus was detected",OTH,OTH,Cytarabine (NGX); Palivizumab,Unknown,"Antibiotics; Mechanical ventilation, Extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation support",,PHHY2015US170668

When I woke up on Saturday morning (I had received my vaccine on Thursday evening), I noticed that I had a large, red, swollen mark where my vaccine had been received. In the preceding 48 hours I had increasingly higher fevers and chills (vacillating between 94 and 101), headaches, muscle aches in my neck, shoulders, and back, and I could not move my arm above my head, or put on a shirt without excruciating pain (like a 6 or 7 on a 10-point pain scale). My resting heart rate was between 80 and 110 bpm (it's typically 60-70). The swelling grew in size at about half an inch a day (both deep and wide). I could barely lift anything or bend down either. I began immediately taking Advil and Benadryl, and applying hydrocortisone cream to the site. I also rested, drank a lot of water, and applied hot and cold packs to the site. However, each day it worsened. Finally, on Monday morning I went back to the pharmacist who immunized me - and a physicians assistant at a local clinic - and both seemed alarmed, but told me to wait and keep applying the same treatments I had been doing. The physicians assistant told me to come back on Wednesday to receive antibiotics if conditions did not improve. However, as the conditions kept worsening, on Monday evening, approximately 96 hours after receiving the vaccine, I consulted with my mother (a retired RN nurse) and she recommended I try taking azitromicina (Z-pack) as this seemed particularly severe to her. I did so, and 12 hours after my first dose - as I write this - my fever has been reduced (to about 99) and more importantly the vaccination spot has not grown in size today.

This report refers to a 20 year old subject enrolled in a not blinded other studies. The study population comprised patients of the private, multispeciality group practice with regional centers, the clinic maintained an electronic vaccination registry for immunizations administered by clinic providers, local public health agencies, and immunization providers. No measles cases were reported in the area during the study period. Two cohorts comprising 685 subjects were enrolled during 2009-2010. Cohort 1 (113 subjects) participated in a 10-year longitudinal study at the clinic examining immunogenicity and adverse events following the second MMR II vaccine dose (hereafter, ""the longitudinal study""). To achieve adequate sample size, the clinic's vaccination registry was used to recruit subjects from cohort 2 for whom receipt of 2 MMR II doses was documented but who did not participate in the longitudinal study (572 subjects). Invitation letters were mailed to both cohorts, and follow-up telephone calls were made. Additionally, cohort 1 subjects who participated in the measles cell mediated immunity (CMI) substudy during the longitudinal study were asked to participate in the current CMI substudy. Although only 16 cohort 1 subjects (14.2%) had low or undetectable MeV antibody concentrations during the longitudinal study, 93 of 113 cohort 1 subjects had low or undetectable concentrations of antibody (defined previously) to at least one of the viruses targeted by MMR II during the longitudinal study, and all cohort 2 subjects were offered a third dose of MMR II. Serum was collected from all subjects immediately before (baseline) and 1 month and 1 year after MMR3 receipt. At each visit, subjects were questioned about measles occurrence, exposures, vaccinations, and other health events. MMR vaccine was administered during the initial visit. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Institutional review boards of the Clinic Research Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved the study. Sample size determination and exclusion criteria were previously described. The 60 participants in the longitudinal measles CMI substudy or subjects with a low or undetectable MeV antibody concentration in greater then or equal to 1 serum specimen collected during the longitudinal study were asked to participate in the current CMI substudy. However, only 34 subjects (56.7%) meeting these criteria were re-enrolled. A convenience sample from cohort 2 was used to reach the recruitment goal of 60 subjects. Laboratory testing was performed at the end of the study. Other than each subject's unique identifier code and serum collection dates, laboratories were blinded to study information. Plaque Reduction Neutralization (PRN) Testing was performed using low-passage Edmonston MeV on Vero cell monolayers, as previously described. End points were determined for all serum samples tested, and 50% neutralizing doses were calculated using the Karber method. Serial 4-fold dilutions of serum were tested in duplicate starting at 1:8 and ending at 1:8192 against virus diluted to give 35-35 plaques/well and run in parallel with the Second WHO International Standard Reference Serum (66/202). After incubating the virus-serum mixtures at 337 degrees centigrade with 5% CO2, the mixtures were transferred onto corresponding 24-well tissue culture plates containing confluent Vero monolayers; after incubating for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, the inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with medium containing carboxy methylcellulose and returned to the incubator for 5 days prior to staining with neutral red and plaque counting. Serum samples from individual subjects were tested in the same assay run. Titers were standardized against the WHO reference serum, with a titer of 1:8 corresponding to 8 miU/mL in this assay.

No information regarding the patients' medical history or concurrent conditions was provided. The objective of the study was to further elucidate the relationship between Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and diabetes. The authors examined the data derived from the Survey from years 2005-2010. Survey was a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children. The authors excluded 13902 subjects who were younger than 20 years of age at the time of screening interview and 851 subjects without body mass index (BMI) information. Then, they excluded 933 patient whom hepatitis B serology was not available and 32 subjects, whose diabetes status could not be determined. From 15316 patients included in the analysis, 4063 patients were vaccinated with doses of hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (manufacturer unknown) injection (dose and route of administration were not reported) on unspecified dates. The vaccination was assessed by self-report. There were no concomitant therapies reported. 91.07% of the vaccinated patients received all 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (manufacturer unknown) and the remaining patients received less than 3 doses. As the analysis was mainly based on the serological results, the authors did not separate the subjects who received all 3 doses or less than 3 doses. It was reported that the immunization status of the patients was assessed by hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) testing. Positive hepatitis B immunization status was based on positive result of HBsAb test and negative results of both HBcAb and HBsAg tests. Any other combination of results was considered as negative hepatitis B immunization status. Out of 4063 patients vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (manufacturer unknown), there was no serological evidence of immunization for hepatitis B in 2476 cases. Therefore, HBV vaccination was deemed to be unsuccessful in those 2476 patients, who were reported to be vaccinated. The outcome of the events was not reported. The reporters considered the event to be related to the therapy with hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (manufacturer unknown). They stated that as the titer of HBV declines with time, the high vaccination failure rate in this sample set could be a time-related issue, however they could not exclude other causes from the limited information available.

Abstract: Given the illness and deaths caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during the first year of life, preventing infant RSV infections through maternal vaccination is intriguing. However, little is known about the extent and maternal effects of RSV infection during pregnancy. We describe 3 cases of maternal RSV infection diagnosed at a center during winter 2014. Case-patient 1 (26 years old, week 33 of gestation) received a diagnosis of RSV infection and required mechanical ventilation. Case-patient 2 (27 years old, week 34 of gestation) received a diagnosis of infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus and RSV and required mechanical ventilation. Case-patient 3 (21 years old, week 32 of gestation) received a diagnosis of group A streptococcus pharyngitis and RSV infection and was monitored as an outpatient. Clarifying the effects of maternal RSV infection could yield valuable insights into potential maternal and fetal benefits of an effective RSV vaccination program. This case involves a 27-year-old female patient who was vaccinated with influenza vaccine (batch number, site of administration were not reported) on unspecified date during pregnancy. It was reported that at the time of vaccination the patient was 34 weeks and day 4 pregnant (gravida), LMP not reported. Hence, it was a case of drug exposure during pregnancy. The patient's prior obstetric history was notable for a spontaneous abortion at 8 weeks, and her medical history was notable for childhood asthma and smoking one half to 1 pack of cigarettes per day before pregnancy and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date after vaccination, patient presented worsening cough, congestion, fevers, chills, dyspnea, fetal hydrocephalus consistent with aqueductal stenosis (which was diagnosed during the second trimester), on hospitalization day 2 experienced membranes ruptured, breech presentation, congestion, pulmonary edema, cough was productive for green sputum, evoked concern for pneumonia, exacerbation of asthma, hypotension, tachycardia. Later the patient was diagnosed with group influenza A (H1N1) virus and RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus infection). On an unknown date patient was hospitalized. Laboratory investigations included rapid influenza test which was negative, leukocyte count was 21*109 cells/L, chest radiograph showed a nonspecific opacity in the right middle lobe, oxygen saturation was stable (94 percent to 94 percent on room air) and nasopharyngeal aspirate was sent to be tested by viral respiratory PCR panel (eSensor; GenMarkDx) which panel was positive for influenza A (H1N1) virus and RSV respectively. The patient was treated with a 5-day course of prednisone and albuterol for exacerbation of asthma, azithromycin for cough and fever and ceftriaxone, vancomycin, azithromycin, and oseltamivir for secondary bacterial infection. At the time of this report patient was not recovered from the events and on an unknown date, patient recovered from pulmonary edema. On hospitalization day 3 at 39 weeks of gestation, the patient underwent a classical cesarean delivery of a (birth weight 3,640 grams) female infant with Apgar scores of 3 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes. Patient remained intubated and was transported to the surgical ICU after delivery. She was extubated without difficulty within an hour of ICU admission and transferred to the postpartum unit 12 hours after delivery. On hospitalization day 10, patient was discharged (discharge date not reported) home with percentage of oxygen saturation in the mid-90s on room air.

A 38 year old male experienced Multiple Sclerosis following the administration of BioThrax (anthrax vaccine adsorbed) and other vaccines. On 05JAN2016, the consumer contacted a pharmaceutical company to report that he was John Cunningham virus (JCV) positive. At that time, he was on therapy with Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Tysabri (natalizumab) for multiple sclerosis. The natalizumab was stopped for the JCV. During contact with the consumer, he revealed to the pharmaceutical company that he felt that there was a link between the multiple sclerosis and anthrax immunization that he received. The pharmaceutical company forwarded the report to the vaccine manufacturer. On 08JAN2016, contact was made with the consumer by the vaccine manufacturer. The consumer reported that he had received the vaccine in two intervals for a total of 5 doses. He recalled that in 1999 his dosage of anthrax vaccine was halted due to the agency ""putting the vaccine on hold for side effects"". Immunization was resumed in approximately 2000-2001. The consumer also recalled that he was immunized for smallpox, Japanese encephalitis, and other vaccines on or around that time.  In 2010, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The consumer stated that he felt the multiple sclerosis was related to anthrax vaccine because he had no prior hereditary issues or autoimmune disorders, and he was told that his multiple sclerosis could be due to ""environmental triggers"" which he attributed to the anthrax vaccine. The consumer denied concurrent medication and medical history at the time of event. Reporter's Comments: Report forwarded from Sanofi, which contains information regarding an Anthrax vaccine. Sender's Comments: This is a consumer report from an individual who received multiple vaccines including BioThrax, smallpox and Japanese encephalitis vaccine and reports his subsequent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. While the consumer believes the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is related to BioThrax vaccination, multiple vaccines were administered on or about the same time.

The patient did not know what was wrong, but she did not feel good. The patient also did not look good had constant dark circles under her eyes, her skin color was ashen and she appeared listless. She missed days at school and other activities (dance and cheerleading). The patient visited pediatrician repeatedly and other specialists including neurologist; ear, nose and throat specialists (ENT's), gastrointestinal specialists (GI), Obstetrician Gynecologist (OBGYN) and made several visits to the emergency room. The patient also received many blood tests, computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was prescribed unspecified medications to alleviate her symptoms but it only made her to feel worse. The pediatrician suggested that patient's illness might be psychosomatic and recommended to visit a psychologist. On an unspecified date in October 2010, the patient was tested for the Lime disease.

I knew the other 3 would have the same vaccine and were given the FLUARIX. The father got the shot first, then the little girl but she was very scared, screaming in the room. While approaching her with the shot, she waved her hand in front of the needle and got a scratch kind of injury. This distracted me. I meant to check the dose of the shot before I gave the younger child but by this time he was confused and getting scared. So the parents and I decided we would give the shot to him quickly and then proceed with the documentation to prevent further agitation. I reached for FLUVIRIN, checked the expiry date, but forgot to check the age range, and gave the child the vaccine. I did not realize my mistake until the next day when I usually go over my day and think of how I could improve myself. I called my manager and let her know and following her advice called the CDC first to know of what to do. I did not have access to the child's information until 3 days and my manager was aware of that. By the next day I received feedback from CDC that no exaggerated adverse events were anticipated and no further vaccination was recommended. The next day I informed the mother who was very upset and angry as to why she wasn't informed as soon as I came to know. I explained to her that it was because my manager told me that the policy was to first check with CDC what their advice was and inform VAERS which was also done by myself. I think this happened partly because the label only had the age information in small letter unlike FLUARIX which had that in big fonts to draw my attention to it.

620028,01/20/2016,,,,,U,01/20/2016,"This literature study report was received from a literature article. The author stated that newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals are 35 to 100-fold more susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection compared to non-infected individuals. Therefore, the PPV23 has previously been recommended, though efficacy and effectiveness of vaccination remains controversial. Early severe B cell dysfunction is a central feature of HIV infection. The specific nature of the immune cells involved in the production of protective antigen-specific antibodies in HIV-positive individuals remains to be elucidated. There were three goals in this study. First, to elucidate the immunogenic response to PPV23 in newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals. Second, to evaluate whether is it potentially beneficial to provide 6-12 months of HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) to suppress viral load and potentially improve immune function before PPV23 vaccination in newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals with CD4<200. Third, to elucidate the phenotypic distribution of PPS-selected B cells in newly diagnosed HIV-positive individuals, dependent on CD4 count, compared to HIV-negative individuals. This case concerns a patient of unknown age and gender. Forty-three pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine naïve newly diagnosed HIV-positive volunteers participated in the open observational study. HIV-positive individuals were stratified according to CD4 counts. Twenty two HIV-negative volunteers participated in this study. All volunteers were vaccinated with PNEUMOVAX 23 (dose and route of administration not provided) on day 0. All adverse events to vaccination were recorded. On an unknown date one patient experienced Arthus-type reaction. The outcome of the events was unknown. The authors considered the event to be related to PNEUMOVAX 23. The authors concluded that despite CD4-dependent pneumococcal polysaccharide-specific deficiencies in newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients, vaccination was beneficial based on opsonophagocytic titers for all newly diagnosed HIV-positive groups. In HIV-positive patients with CD4<200 cells/microL, 6-12 months of HAART did not improve opsonophagocytic titers or antibody concentrations. Based on these findings, immunization with the PNEUMOVAX 23 should not be delayed in newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients with CD4<200 cells/microL.

The patient has no relevant past medical history. On an unknown date, the patient received an influenza virus vaccine (brand and batch number unspecified) to the left arm. The patient did not experience any paresthesias or other symptoms at the time of injection. Sixteen hours post influenza vaccination, the patient developed progressively worsening weakness over his distal left upper extremity.  After 20 hours, the patient experienced total weakness in the affected muscles.  The patient had no past medical history and the review of the systems were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a small puncture wound in the posterolateral portion of his mid-arm approximately 2.5cm distal to the clinically identifiable deltoid tuberosity.  A motor exam demonstrated 4/5 strength in his triceps, 2/5 strength in his brachioradialis and 0/5 strength in wrist extension, finger extension and thumb extension.  No sensory abnormalities were noted. The remainder of the neurovascular exam was within normal limits. The day after influenza vaccination, the patient presented to an outpatient hand surgery clinic complaining of left wrist drop.  An magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the left upper arm on the day after the injection revealed edema along the course of the radial nerve without focal collection. The nerve itself was not grossly enlarged or damaged. Ultrasound (US) examination of the patient's arm on the day after the injection demonstrated swelling of the radial nerve in the distal third of the arm starting approximately 3 cm distal to the injection site. At the center of the swollen segment, an adhesive band was identified as compressing the nerve, likely an incidental finding since the band was not near the site of injection and the nerve was found to be swollen proximally and distally to the band. Given the results of the MR and the US, the impression was that the nerve palsy was secondary to a demyelinating process related to inflammation around the nerve and not to axonal damage. A splint and a steroid taper were prescribed. Surgery in the form of neurolysis was offered but the patient elected non-operative management. One month following the injury, nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) demonstrated severe left radial neuropathy with total motor axonal loss with sparing of the radial sensory nerve.  A follow-up ultrasound obtained at the same time revealed progression of the swelling of the radial nerve in both size and craniocaudal extent, with involvement of the posterior interosseous nerve and signs of supinator atrophy.  This swelling and atrophy were absent on the ultrasound taken the day after injury. Approximately six months post initial injury, the patient reported progressive improvement in motor symptoms beginning with the brachioradialis and progressive inferiorly to his thumb extensor over time. At one year post injury, physical examination revealed 5/5 strength in his triceps, 5/5 strength in his brachioradialis and 4/5 strength in wrist extension, finger extension and thumb extension.  The patient reported minimal functional limitations and was able to resume work in full. The outcome was recovered. Reporter's Comments: Reporter's comments: Imaging suggests that the nerve injury was caused by injection of the vaccination into the nerve sheath and not the nerve itself.  It is hypothesised that the injectate dissected down the tissue planes along the radial nerve causing a chemical neuritis, leading to axonal ischemia and axon loss.  The progressive development of symptoms over time supports the notion that the palsy developed secondary to an inflammatory process.  Alternatively, it is also possible that the total axonal loss was due to ischemia from a chemical neuritis induced by the injectate.  The authors believe the reason for the palsy was inappropriate location of the injection. Sender'",,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,UNK,UNK,,,,,USBEH2016057645

On an unknown date, the patient received an intramuscular injection of an influenza virus vaccine (brand and batch number unspecified) to the deltoid region of the arm. The patient reported 3 weeks of right shoulder pain beginning during vaccination. She noted more pain than usual during the vaccination and stabbing.  The patient experienced 9/10 shoulder pain with internal/external rotation and adduction afterwards. She denied any instability, clicking/popping, neurologic symptoms in the arm/hand, or any new repetitive activity. On examination, active internal/external rotation, resisted external rotation both with the shoulder adducted and abducted to 90 degrees and shoulder impingement maneuvers were painful. Reflexes, strength, sensation and AC joint provacative maneuvers were normal. Traumatic infraspinatus and/or teres minor tendon injury was suspected as the cause of her pain. She received little benefit from oral anti-inflammatory medication, a diagnostic subacromial lidocaine injection and 6 physical therapy sessions. T2-weighted shoulder MRI demonstrated infraspinatus tendinosis without frank tear. She was scheduled to undergo ultrasound-guided diagnostic lidocaine injection of the infraspinatus tendon sheath. The outcome was not reported. Reporter's Comments: Reporter's comments: In this case, improper injection proximally into the deltoid muscle resulted in infraspinatus tendon injury. Iatrogenic infraspinatus tendon injury during deltoid IM injection is a rare complication. Sender's Comments: Company comments: Seriousness: Serious. Medically significant. Listedness: Unlisted. Brand of vaccine not specified. Assessment according to the CCSI for CSL Inactivated Influenza Virus Vaccine and the Afluria Product Information, all events are unlisted, except for injection site pain. Causality: Possible. Increased pain was noted upon vaccine injection, with eventual development of impairment of shoulder joint motion and pain in the following 3 weeks. This patient developed signs and symptoms consistent with previously described cases of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) in literature. SIRVA is due to an inflammatory effect from vaccine administration into the subdeltoid bursa. This inflammatory response may be due either to the antigenic or nonantigenic components of the vaccine. Given the temporal relationship and the plausible mechanism, this case is assessed as possibly related.",,,,,,,,,U,,,,,UNK,UNK,,,,,USBEH2016057734

PA and hospital report indicates it could be from the injections. Three (3) different vaccines administered, Thursday, November 12, 2015 about Noon-12:15 pm, by pharmacist. I reported this reaction by phone to my doctor (Monday, Nov. 16?), and also a pharmacist (19th) where the injections were given. All 3 injections were given in my left arm/shoulder because I have a torn rotator cuff on my right shoulder. The shingles vaccine was injected under the skin under my upper left arm and the other 2 injections were given in the top of my shoulder. As I expected, my left shoulder was tender to the touch, and very uncomfortable when leaning on it, similar to past immunizations. I report this because I had to go to the emergency room where white cells/bacteria were found in my blood. I was told there by the PA that it was probably introduced with the vaccine injections. On 11-12-15 I had a 10:00 a.m. appointment with Dr. at the local clinic, not for an illness, but for a routine, 6-month appointment, including a routine blood test. Everything was fine. I talked with Dr. about having the 3 immunizations that another clinic had recommended when I was there Sept. 22. Both Dr. and a pharmacist said it shouldn't be a problem to have all three vaccines at one time. She contacted the local pharmacy. I had no problems until about 10:50 p.m. that night.

Yes, they are as can be attested to with polio, smallpox, rubella diphtheria, measles and tetanus. How do we address the concerns mentioned earlier? One answer is to give one vaccine at a time, which would help identify which vaccine gives an adverse reaction. Added to this, waiting 90 days between live virus vaccines is prudent. Last, never give a vaccine to a child who has been ill in the last 2 weeks, or if there are signs of inflammation, such as active allergies, wheezing, or eczema"".

That same day, she went into work, was sent to ER/OT and was admitted to hospital for a mild/moderate allergic reaction.  Treatment comprised of prednisone (20 mg for 4 days) due to her diphenhydramine (Benadryl) allergy.

At the age of 12 months (in approximately 1999) and at the age of 4 years (in approximately 2002), the patient was vaccinated with doses of MMR vaccine (manufacturer unknown) (lot number, expiry date, dose, site and route of administration not reported). On 14-FEB-2015, the patient was seen in an emergency department for evaluation of reactive airway disease. In the waiting room at the same time there were two children who were later confirmed to have measles. The patient began a 5-day course of prednisone (manufacturer unknown) (oral tablet, 50 mg daily); however, symptoms continued, and the patient returned to the emergency department the next day (on 15-FEB-2015) and received methylprednisolone (125 mg, intravenously). The patient had documented receipt of two doses of MMR vaccine (manufacturer unknown), therefore was not administered with intramuscular immune globulin after they had been identified as a person exposed to the two children with measles. On 02-MAR-2015, 16 days after the first emergency department visit, the patient was hospitalized for vomiting and dehydration. The patient was also found to be febrile and to have a confluent popular rash that began on the face and spread to trunk and extremities and had small vesicular oral lesions. Measles was confirmed by laboratory testing (on an unknown day in approximately March 2015), and the patient received supportive treatment with anti-emetics and intravenous fluids. The author concluded that it was not known whether the patient developed immunity to measles in response to the administered doses of MMR vaccine (manufacturer unknown) or whether the patient had an unrecognized immunocompromising condition, but the recent steroid use might have weakened the patient's immune response and rendered the patient susceptible to wild measles strain. The outcome of the measles and vaccination failure was not reported. The author considered vaccination failure and measles to be related to MMR vaccine (manufacturer unknown), since the patient had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine (manufacturer unknown) and did not meet criteria for being severely immunocompromised, but did develop measles after being exposed in the setting of a hospital emergency department to patients with laboratory-confirmed measles.

The patient did not recover from the adverse events (""still tired a lot and get migraines""), but they learned to deal with them. The reporter did not assess the relationship between the suspect drug and the events (the patient's doctors rejected the idea that the vaccine was associated with the events, they blamed it on dysautonomia and said that tiredness could be due to the fact that the patient was playing all of the sports and then suddenly stopped).

At 2 years of age, he underwent genetic evaluation at another hospital, and the chromosomes were reportedly normal. When the patient was 10 years of age, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed because of chronic headaches and nausea. The images showed numerous nonspecific, nonenhancing lesions (measure no more than 8 mm in diameter) in the bilateral periventricular and corona radiata white matter. Results of magnetic resonance angiography were normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, levels of vitamin B12 and C-reactive protein, and antinuclear antibody titers were reportedly normal. A monospot test was negative, as was testing for Lyme disease and DNA for CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy).

October 6, 2015 Can not move left arm, very painful, can barely walk, left leg does not seem to work well, almost fell on way to bathroom. Felt as if I has no control of the movements of the left side of my body. No change for 7 days as I spent all the time in a recliner. October 14, 2015 Can now lift my left arm approximately 6 inches, left leg is beginning to work but does not synchronize with my right leg while trying to walk. Soles of feet have stinging sensations constantly and skin feels as if it is being poked with needles. My right side is starting to respond similarly to my left side. My arms feel as if they are asleep for a couple hours at a time. Sometimes hands and feet will tingle for an hour or so. I have no sensation in my fingertips, I can not feel things. My fingernails have broken to the quick and are not growing. October 30, 2015 I can lift my arms high enough to put on shirts, but is very painful. My left arm hurts constantly. Nov. 11, 2015 My legs seem to work together  a little better. There have been two instances when everything seemed to be working fairly well and without ant warning both legs just seemed almost paralyzed. One time I was at market and did not think I could get to my car in the parking lot. This frightened me so much that I now carry a folding cane at all times. Nov. 16, 2015 I had a dr. appointment today. The dr. had an intern student on staff that day. She was sent in to see me. I was in terrible condition and I told her about all of my symptoms. She talked with me for about 30 minutes. She recorded all of the information into the computer. The dr. entered the room and stated that this was going to be a short visit- Do you need any medication refills? He did not examine me, I question his examination report for that day. Nov. 22, 2015 I am now having bladder problems. I can not keep my urine stream going. It is difficult to start urinating, and then the flow stops, sometimes I start and stop urinating 9-10 times before I can empty my bladder. This occurs event if  my bladder seems very full. I have never had this problem previously and I have not had any medication changes. It is a struggle to ensure that I get my bladder empty. Today I went to the bathroom, when I pulled down my pants I was surprised to discover that I had soiled my pants. It was very runny, I had not passed gas, I did not know it had happened. Now I fear it will happen when  I am not home. Dec. 6, 2015 I think I have a bladder infection, but a trip to the dr. and a urine test does not indicate an infection. Even though I have had muscular pain for a few years, all of the new pains are completely different. I hope these new pains recede soon as I just seem to be getting weak and do not seem to be seeing any improvement. I have started physical therapy, trying to improve my legs. Jan. 6, 2016 I had an MRI today, to check for any physical reason that my bladder does not work correctly.

There was no pain; needle marks; redness; or after affects. I have not had a cold in nine (9) years. Now, I have been cursed!! When I asked for a pneumonia shot, my MD was not the person who administered the shot; who, at no time, explained in full detail what the consequences of the strength of this pneumonia shot would be. The shot was given as follows: The needle was inserted into top of my left shoulder, and it stung. Then, it turned red! When I arrived home, the upper section of my left arm turned RED! It hurt, and there was pain. I put alcohol on the area. In a few days the redness evaporated, but the arm was achy, ad then there was pain. I did contact the doctor's office when the arm turned red, and was told to call back if it became worse. It did get worse. I spoke to Dr., and told him there was pain and severe headaches. He also stated to call him back, if it got worse. I asked him if I could get a stroke or heart attack. He stated: ""No."" The third call I made was to schedule an appointment with Dr. He suggested an x-ray of my left arm. The results were: beginning of arthritis!! He did mention to take ADVIL twice a day and some light exercise. This is what I eventually took to relieve the pressure and pain: ADVIL or TYLENOL light exercise heating pad. The existing conditions to this day are: Sniffles, runny nose, sneezing, achiness: Joint and muscle, Stiffness: neck; Shoulder, Back, Pain: neck; shoulder arm, headaches, tiredness. On Wednesday, 6 January 2016, a blood red spot appeared on the left side of my left eye. in four (4) days it disappeared. My other medical conditions are; High blood pressure, High cholesterol, Sinus condition, Arthritis. I am allergic to: Penicillin, aspirin, SUDAFED, Lisinopril, Lovastatin, PREVNAR 13. I did report this mele of circumstances to Health Plan, but was told that I only up to 60 days to report any backlash from P-13. I am still experiencing all the conditions listed in this letter. If I had bee given a clearer insight into P-13's shot, I would not have taken it. all medical personnel should thoroughly advise and give a better interpretation of what this pneumonia shot is capable of to all recipients. I am a senior who thought I was going into never-never land!! On Wednesday, 13 January 2016, I contacted Dr's office to have lab work done. The person I spoke with stated she would call me back.

A previously unvaccinated, breastfed girl was given 2 doses of Prevnar13 (a full series of two shots since it was delayed). The first was at age 12 months (10/30/15), and the second was at age 15 months (01/22/2016).  Her health and temperature at both visits were normal, and there were no diet or diapering changes before or after either visit. About one day after the 10/15 shot, she experienced foul-smelling poop. There were about 2 poops in one day that had less water than usual, then later that day or the next day there were about 3 soft (but not fully runny) foul-smelling poops every 2-3 hours. The parents believed it was a coincidence, and the girl showed no other symptoms apart from slight tiredness, that may have been unrelated. She was treated at home with almond oil, A&D, baths, air drying, and Triple Paste. While the rash was painful and bright red the first day, the next day it turned into red raised bumps from anus to genitals that lasted about 2-3 days. As it showed improvement and seemed to not be painful after the first day of discovery, she was treated at home, and the rash was fully gone at the end of a week. The same symptoms (but with more severity) happened after her 1/22 shot. This time, the foul-smelling runny poops started the morning of the 23rd, and there were about 4-5 of them, one every 2 hours. The rash this time, however, was more severe. After the first runny poop (the morning of the 23rd), a larger diaper area turned bright solid red, and she screamed and cried when it was touched. By the 24th, the rash again turned into bright red raised bumps (very numerous and close together) from anus to genitals, spreading out to inner thigh, but there was no more diarrhea or signs of her discomfort. The bright red color was gone by the morning of the 27th, and the rash was gone fully by the 28th. Again, she showed slight signs of tiredness, but no other symptoms. Lastly, the parents primarily cloth diaper, and the father reported that his clothes severely itched him on the 26th. They wondered if this was because the clothes he was wearing were washed in a separate load after a diaper load from the 25th.

About 5:45 P.M. that evening, I went to the bedroom to wake her up and I returned to another room. I went back to check on her twice until the third time of no response; I tried to get her to get out of bed. She was not responsive to my directions, disoriented, and confused. At this time, I called 911 for an ambulance. When the medics arrived her body temperature was 101.5 F degrees. I told them about the vaccine that she had earlier that day. They gave her TYLENOL and started an IV and took her to hospital. At hospital she was treated in the ER after drawing blood and getting urine samples. About 10:00 P.M. the nurse said that she had some type of infection. While in the ER she was given MOTRIN and various antibiotics (ZOYSN). It was decided later that she needed to be admitted for at least one day. About 1:20 A.M. December 18, 2015, she was admitted into the ICU Unit for treatment. Patient was treated here at hospital from 12/17/2015-12/28/2015. My first meeting with Dr. we talked about why she was brought to the hospital and her medical history.

A 68-years-old female patient received PREVNAR 13 (NDC number: 000051971-05), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 31Dec2015 at 0.5 ml single. Medical history included ongoing seizure; hurt her left leg from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had x-ray of head a long time before when first began having seizures, maybe 30 years before, which showed black spot on left side of her head. It didn't go all the way down into her brain, hadn't grown, no explanation why it was there. Thought to be the cause of her seizures. The patient previously took PREVNAR 13 about 10 years before and experienced no adverse event. Concomitant medication included DILANTIN for seizure. Patient used to be on 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening until about six months before when she had her phenytoin level checked and it was too high. At that time, she decreased her dose to 100mg one in the morning and 200 mg at night. On 01Jan2016 at 18:00 the patient had seizure which the patient believed was due to the PREVNAR 13. They were at a friend's house, her friend knew she was having a seizure because she grabbed the card table she was eating off of, was shaking it, and her friend could not get reporter's hand off of it. Has history of accident in which she hurt her left leg. Thought she hurt it again during the seizure as it was still sore. They called the ambulance to take her to emergency room, where she spent 18 hours. The patient was happy enough to walk to the ambulance to go. While at hospital, they attempted to release her on three different occasions. They started to release her the first time, but she couldn't walk so they kept her. Next time they told her she was free to go, she couldn't speak so they kept her. Next time they said they were keeping her for more tests, did EKG and heart ultrasound, which came back fine on 02Jan2016. An head scan on 02Jan2016 was normal. The patient also had lab work on the same date, including phenytoin level, which showed she had no phenytoin in her system because she had been without her phenytoin for 18 hours. After this seizure, she increased her phenytoin (NDC: 0071036924, Lot: M38474, EXP: July2017) to 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening.

Two days after the immunization (9/18/15), she contacted her health care provider to report these symptoms along with expansion of the pruritus to her hand as well as hand stiffness.  Following the adverse event, she took ibuprofen 600mg orally.  The patient was offered an evaluation by her health care provider, but she declined.

It is possible the reported hand stiffness was due to musculoskeletal stiffness (reaction described in the package insert) or was secondary to the swelling in the affected limb, but this is unable to be confirmed as the patient declined an evaluation by the provider on the day the symptoms were reported.

March 19, 2007 - varicella (VARIVAX) was administered - this was the only vaccine given at this well child appointment. March 23, 2007 - I called doctor's office because of high fever 104.5, lethargy and his arm muscles were twitching  - asked if this was a reaction to this vaccine. Doctor said it wasnt' typical of the vaccine said to make an appointment to be seen. March 27, 2007 - office visit doctor said not typical of vaccine but she also said she didn't know what was really going on. Doctor prescribed Amoxicillin in case there was something bacterial going on. (When I called to get these dates I was also told the doctor had a diagnosis of an ear infection in the right ear as the reason for prescribing the Amoxicillin. In my actual conversation with the doctor she said absolutely nothing about an ear infection, the only thing she said was she didn't know exactly, but to try an antibiotic in case it was something bacterial - no mention of ear infection). March 27, 2007 ordered 1st of 4 labs/blood test. March 28, 2007 phone call w/results indicated very low white blood cell count - 2.8. Doctor changed diagnosis to ""viral"".

I also reported this situation to the Health Department.

To our knowledge he did make a full recovery from this event. This has been a very frustrating situation for our family. With all that happened the doctor's office was in this denial that it had anything to do with this vaccine because ""it didn't happen within the ""normal"" time frame of when a person could react"" - every body is different and every body reacts whenever it is going to react, just because it's not ""by the book"" doesn't mean that our experience had nothing to do with this vaccine.

Symptoms persisted so my doctor ordered an MRI of my brain which did not reveal any abnormality.  I am told I may have Sjogren's syndrome and it will take time for symptoms to improve.

I had mentioned that I'm currently pregnant and all the prescriptions I was taking which are many. They include, prenatal vitamins, amplify for schizo affective disorder which I question because all I have is a conversation issue, CLARITIN, a nausea medication as needed, TYLENOL for my frequent headaches, turn and possibly there's more but I just can't think of them now. The doctor had nothing for me to help with all I simply came there for was a annual physical; so she was just trying to make think pregnancy was depressing and kept ramparting on pre/post pardon depression. Even gave me a paper for meeting assuming I'm going to be depressed.

At 38 weeks and 2 days, the infant was born via vaginal delivery and weighed 3430 grams (7lbs 9oz) at birth. APGAR score was 8. The infant was diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly (serious criteria GSK medically significant and congenital anomaly). On an unknown date, the infant experienced maternal vaccine exposure. On an unknown date, the outcome of the Ebstein's anomaly and maternal vaccine exposure was unknown. The reporter considered the Ebstein's anomaly to be possibly related to ENGERIX B adult.

The patient's mother did not use benzodiazepines or lithium prior to or during pregnancy, had no dysrhythmia, and no toxic occupational exposure. The investigator did not consider the patent foramen ovale as a separate serious adverse event as it was part of the Ebstein's anomaly and would perinatal take a while to close. Relevant medical history of mother included two prior pregnancies, environmental allergies (1994), being overweight (30th July 2014), and ADHD (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder).

622266,02/10/2016,MD,70.0,70,,F,02/05/2016,"My wife is the subject of this report. I am writing this as an eyewitness to the events following her ""over 65"" flu vaccine administered at approximately noon on Wednesday, November 4, 2015. My wife does have several health issues (mechanical heart valve, arthritis, pre-diabetic, lactose intolerant and high blood pressure which is under control and is on a number of medications which are attached for section 17). Prior to the administration of this vaccine, she was able to walk and was not feeling ill. I am not a doctor, so I will be using laymen's terms to describe this decline in her health during the afternoon and evening of November 4, 2015. Patient had a noon appointment for an ""over 65"" flu shot on November 4, 2015. She was able to walk into the office and upon the completion of her visit was able to walk back to the car. Shortly thereafter, we returned to our home and she was able to walk into our house with no problem. During the afternoon, she progressively felt worse. Her first symptom was heartburn about an hour after her shot. Approximately 2-3 hours later she had intense chills to the point of having to have three blankets over her but still had chills, more heartburn, wheezing, difficulty breathing and irregular/rapid heartbeat. Toward the evening, she attempted to get up to go to the bathroom. She was so weak, especially in her lower back and legs, that she could not get up even with the assistance of a walker. Finally, with my help, we got her up to hold on to the walker. This was extremely difficult for her to do. I held on to her as she made her way to the bathroom which took a very long time. She got in the bathroom and on the toilet but again it was a very slow process. After being on the toilet, I attempted many times to help her stand up so she could hold on to the walker. As I was helping her get up, I was holding her under her arms but I just could not hold to her. With my hands under her arms, patient slowly dropped to the bathroom floor. At that point, I decided that we needed to call 911. At approximately 8:45 p.m., the ambulance arrived. They were able to get patient up and onto a chair and then onto a stretcher. Her blood pressure was elevated and she was having an irregular heartbeat, a rapid heartbeat and extreme weakness. When she arrived at the hospital, she did have a fever of 100.4 degrees as well as rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. Patient remained at hospital for seven days. Following patient's release from the hospital, she was admitted for rehabilitation. She spent three weeks there and received physical and occupational therapy. Following her stay, she received home care services for several weeks. She received, primarily, physical therapy to assist her with her balance and to strengthen her legs so she could walk without a walker. Currently, patient improved enough so that she no longer needs to use her walker unless her arthritis becomes a problem. Please note, that in the hospital/doctor's report, staff indicates that they did not feel that this was caused by the ""over 65"" flu shot; however, we were both told by the admitting physician that he would not rule out that this could have been a reaction to the flu shot. Patient was told by at least one other hospitalist that what happened was a reaction to the flu shot which she received. She also has been told by two additional physicians that she is to no longer get the ""over 65"" vaccine. As an eye-witness to this event, I am positive that the vaccine did create this severe reaction. Patient is now very concerned regarding receiving any flu shot in the future. This needs to be addressed by someone at VAERS or the CDC. We would also like to know if the flu strains were different from any other year. We would appreciate a call from someone at your office to explain this.",,,Y,Y,Y,8,,,Y,11/04/2015,11/04/2015,0,See attached hospital information,PVT,UNK,Digoxin; Gabapentin; Lansoprazole; Metoprolol succinate; Warfarin sodium; Lactase; Ramipril; Spironolactone; Prednisone; LASIX,,"Atrial fibrillation; GERD; Congestive heart failure with unknown ejection fraction; Mitral valve replacement; Chronic back pain related to spinal nerve pain, with bilateral neuropathy and arthritis; Hypertension; Adenoidectomy; Tonsillectomy",,

I WAS ASSIGNED AS A  WORKER IN THE LABORATORIES. I was not given a choice to refuse vaccines. I HAD AN immediate reaction to the vaccines.  I experienced flu like symptoms, chronic fatigue, malaise, chronic joint pain and was given bed rest for a period. And soon after in months developed asthma and large lymph breast mass. I have not been able to maintain employment or relationships since that time. In addition to the multiple mandatory vaccines received, I worked in a building that housed monkeys and mice and mosquitoes being subjected to the anthrax, Ebola and Rift Valley fever virus or spores etc. and anyone who didn't take the vaccines ordered was threatened and intimidated and forced to comply. They were many anthrax samples missing and unaccounted for and never recovered during my year employed there. I was supervised directly by one scientist and given tasks by multiple scientists prior years to 1992 and subsequent years after my employment there are many national articles about the atrocities and unknowns from 1991 until 2007...including improperly rejected claims of GULF WAR ILLNESS applying to practices at facility. Missing spores and bio agents were the norm. Shameful record keeping of locations of spores and bio agents and lax to nonexistent security, including a scientist who was federally charged with transporting and using anthrax as a terrorist weapon in 2001; finally facility added to national superfund cleanup site list because of improper BIO AGENT disposal at facility at 4 large outdoor facility locations, possibly hundreds to thousands of vials of BIO AGENTS DISPOSED OF IMPROPERLY ON THE GROUNDS including live anthrax vials found less than a foot below the surface...prompting class action lawsuit. I was in perfect health when I began my employment at facility in 1992 FORWARD TO 24 years after I believe and my medical history demonstrates I was exposed dually to vaccine and probable spores; my health issues are neuralgias, chronic multi-joint pain/ multi joint degenerative arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, Bell's palsy, spinal defect staph infections grand posi coxi, COPD/asthma.

Lack of effect is also listed as vaccine efficacy is not 100%. Causality: Possible. Time to onset is 3 days for initial events(drowsiness, malaise, chills, fever) and 6 days for respiratory tract symptoms. The time to onset is not consistent for lack of efficacy as seroconversion following immunisation takes at least 2 weeks. Additionally there is no lab data to suggest Influenza infection. The events most likely represent Influenza like illness which is defined as fever, in association with  upper respiratory tract symptoms (nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea) and 2 systemic symptoms (chills malaise).

They checked my heart, checked my right arm for a blood clot, everything was o.k, then they saw a rash on my arm and realized I had shingles. The E.R. doctor took me off the other pain pills and gave me pills to help with the virus. The rash went from my wrist under arm to my elbow then up to my shoulder, across the top of my shoulder and spread out over my shoulder blade down to where the pain started. For the next 3-4 weeks I could only sleep for 30 min. at a time because of the burning pain in my arm and shoulder. In Nov. I called Dr. office and they gave me gabapentin 100 mg. For nerve pain.

I gave him a neb mask treatment and the wheezing cleared up. I went ahead and did an RSV test but this was negative. Thus may just be the onset of some croup. However it was certainly related from a time point of view within an hour of giving him his flu shot so it could also be a flu shot reaction but he responded well to the breathing treatment.

We noticed the pharmacist seemed clumsy while getting out supplies, but didn't know there could be a serious problem since we had never had problems with a vaccine before. The pharmacist gave me a shot first. It felt like he had done it too hard. Then he gave my husband a shot and blood was dripping down my husband's arm and the pharmacist was slow to do anything about it. When someone has been well trained or has lot of experience their movements are smooth and quick. They have the cotton ball ready to go and the bandaid, but he was klutzy. My arm hurt then but I thought it would go away in a couple of days. Instead it kept hurting so I took some OTC pain pills. Then I noticed that certain movements of my left arm (where the shot was given) hurt so much I stopped making those movements. Straight movements were ok but nothing to the side or back or up, as when putting my hair in a ponytail. I couldn't pick up my toddler grandkids anymore. I now wear shirts that button down the front because it hurts too much to put my arm thru a sleeve with an upwards and sideways motion. When I would roll onto my left side in bed it hurt, and I am a left-side sleeper. This keeps waking me up throughout the night. After 2 months of thinking it would get better on its own, thinking if he had hit a nerve there wouldn't be much that could be done anyway, I did some Internet research and found that it has been given a name: SIRVA. I read accounts of women who experienced what I was going through. I still gave it a few more weeks since some of the women said nothing had helped. Then with the pain still bad and certain movements very painful I went to see my primary care doctor. We ruled out a blood clot with an ultrasound, then after a second visit also did an xray of the left humerus, then an MRI of the humerus. This MRI showed degenerative changes of the shoulder so I then had an MRI of the shoulder. The MRI of the shoulder showed a partial thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon. At time at my desk job I have pain up and down my arm, and I avoid the movements that are very painful. I take 5 ALEVE a day. If I don't take ALEVE even just holding my arm straight I can feel pain, sometimes a deep ache. I have to try to put my arm on an extra pillow in a certain way to try to get sleep. I use heat daily to help with the discomfort and have iced the upper arm/shoulder a few times also. A friend who is a physical therapist showed me 2 exercises/stretches to do telling me I couldn't stop using my shoulder completely or it would be even worse. I have now scheduled an appointment with an orthopedist. I don't know if I will eventually need surgery or not. This all started with the Flu shot. It was not the vaccine; it was his use of the needle. In one of the article I read it mentioned that most of the people this has happened to are women who are not very big. I weight 125 lbs. Articles about this state that the pain can last for months or years.",,,,,,,,,N,10/03/2015,10/03/2015,0,"X ray, left humerus; MRI, left humerus; MRI, left shoulder",UNK,OTH,PRILOSEC,None,None,,

On an unknown date, the patient received Hepatitis B vaccine at an unknown dose. In November 2013, several years after receiving Hepatitis B vaccine, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant) and hepatitis b (serious criteria GSK medically significant).

Dosages unknown; administration routes and sites unspecified; batch numbers was not provided. In November 2013, date unspecified, several years after the vaccination, the patient tested positive for hepatitis C viral antibodies with an undetectable hepatitis C viral RNA initially followed by a low level viremia whole admitted due to an tricuspid valve endocarditis. She was persistently negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, but she tested positive for hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B viral DNA in 2 separate occasions. In addition to this, the patient became positive for hepatitis B core antibodies during her admission. However, she was negative for hepatitis B e antigens and hepatitis B core antibodies and had no detectable hepatitis B viral DNA six months later. According to the authors, this meant that the infection had subsided. This case was considered as medically relevant by GSK due to suspected vaccination failure.

That evening, 11/18/2016, she spiked a 102 fever overnight from Wednesday to Thursday that I assumed was related but a normal immune response. Then she had a couple dirty diapers that were green and kind of liquid that really burned her bottom. We hadnt eaten anything new except she had applesauce (natural, unsweetened) for the first time Wednesday night and Thursday with lunch, but I dont think that can cause stomach upset.... anyway, she was in bed that Wednesday night asleep by 8:30pm. She was still asleep the next morning (11/19/2015) at 10:32am! I went in and checked to make sure she was breathing frequently. She would kind of rouse a little then lay down and go back to sleep. I messaged our doctors messaging system to see if I should be concerned or do anything. My other two never did this. Even if ill, they never slept nor sleep that much. She already had a low grade temp (100.4) when we saw Dr. on Wednesday but no other symptoms until after the vaccine. She slept and slept and slept from bed time (8:30pm) the evening of the day she got the vaccine and just wouldnt  rouse. When I finally did get her up to offer her to nurse, she was very fussy, which isnt like her at all. I went in to change clothes about 11:15am (day following vaccine 11/19/15) and she didnt wake but I dropped a shoe and she woke and saw me and fussed to get up so I got her up and nursed her and she fell right back asleep. My husband came home a few minutes later for lunch and he changed her diaper while I ran a quick errand and he said it was wet, but not that wet - and she had been asleep 15 hours... and she then fell back asleep in his arms and he held her until I got home. I got home and all she wanted was to nurse and sleep. I laid her down again around 1:20pm after nursing for a while and she continued sleeping. I then messaged our doctors office again. They stayed in touch checking in on her. She finally woke around 4pm that afternoon and nursed but was fussy and stayed very fussy and tired that day. It was then a rough few days. After the 20 hour sleeping marathon, she continued to have temperature spikes between ibuprofen doses. Being in touch with our doctor, we continued to treat symptoms at home. On Friday 11/20/15, she was awake more but still spiking a fever, fussy, and I noticed she was posturing with her left fist/arm where her left thumb was tucked in her fist and her arm pulled back. I would try to open up her hand and she would pull it back into that position. THIS IS WHAT SCARED ME THE MOST! The posturing! This lasted for several days along with the high fever. So Saturday 11/21/2015 we took her in to a clinic and saw a pediatrician - she said her right ear was infected so she got a shot of rocephin antibiotic. However, this was based on just some ear redness and no tests were done to confirm infection and whether it was bacterial or viral. Sunday morning she seemed to be perking up, her temp was around 100.3 and she hadnt had any ibuprofen since the clinic about 5:30pm Saturday. So we went ahead and came to traveled for the Thanksgiving holiday, on Sunday 11/22/2015. About an hour into the trip, she cried so I stopped to check her diaper and nurse her. Her temperature was back up over 102 (this was about 11:30am Sunday), so I gave her infant ibuprofen. She traveled pretty well and slept a lot, nursed pretty well and had a good number of wet diapers. Her cough was worse - and really wet. At bed time her temp was 98.8 so I thought behind us. Monday morning, 11/23/2015, her temp ran 100.2 to 99.8 so still elevated but not too bad - and her last ibuprofen was 11:30am yesterday. Also on Monday 11/23/2015 her body was covered (trunk and face and neck) with a rash - it didnt seem to bother her and wasnt raised at all. Shes also continued to cough quite a bit.

The following is verbatim from the article: Background: Reporting of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination can help identify rare or unexpected complications of immunizations and aid in characterizing potential vaccine safety signals. We developed an open-source, generalizable clinical decision support system called Electronic Support for Public Health-Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (ESP-VAERS) to assist clinicians with AE detection and reporting. Methods: ESP-VAERS monitors patients' electronic health records for new diagnoses, changes in laboratory values and new allergies following vaccinations. When suggestive events are found, ESP-VAERS sends the patient's clinician a secure electronic message with an invitation to affirm or refute the message, add comments, and submit an automated, prepopulated electronic report to VAERS. High-probability AEs are reported automatically if the clinician does not respond. We implemented ESP-VAERS in December 2012 throughout an integrated healthcare system. We queried the VAERS database to determine the system's baseline reporting rates from January 2009 to March 2012 and then assessed changes in reporting rates with ESP-VAERS. Results: In the 8 months following implementation, 91 622 vaccinations were given. ESP-VAERS sent 1385 messages to responsible clinicians describing potential AEs. Clinicians opened 1304 (94.2 percent) messages, responded to 209 (15.1 percent), and confirmed 16 for transmission to VAERS. An additional 16 high-probability AEs were sent automatically. Reported events included seizure, pleural effusion, and lymphocytopenia. The odds of a VAERS report submission during the implementation period were 30.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.52-95.5) times greater than the odds during the comparable preimplementation period. Conclusions: An open-source, electronic health record-based clinical decision support system can increase AE detection and reporting rates in VAERS.

Patient experienced immediate extreme leg pain at the point where the shot was administered. Doctor was phoned within a few days to request advice regards pain. Doctor stated pain was normal and would subside in few days to weeks. Leg pain continued at the area of the shot without resolution. Patient taken to see Doctor one month to six weeks later, extreme pain still present causing patient immobility. Dr. prescribed therapy. Therapy course completed, minimal to no improvement. Through the duration of aprox one year pain continues to arise particularly after moderate activity, patient is unable to walk or even stand due to extreme pain starting at the point of the shot and radiating through her leg. Doctor Visit Jan 19th, 2015 discussed continuing pain from vaccination. Was advised to file VAERS report. In contradiction to the clear onset of symptoms tracing their direct roots to the moment of administration of vaccination the Doctor advised to follow a course of testing to determine if some underlying systemic pre-existing condition existed that never manifested itself previously even though patient had multiple previous vaccinations and other normal childhood injuries that never resulted in any long term symptoms such as she has experienced directly upon adminstration of the MMR vaccination. To explore another route beside the highly unlikely idea of a possible pre-existing condition diagnosis Doctor consulted a Rheumatologist who advised an X-ray be taken to examine the possibility of injury due to trauma from the injection. X-ray results for Myositis ossificans were negative. As of the day of this report patient continues to experience debilitating leg pain on a regular basis causing her to have to refrain from anything more than minimum physical activities. She is unable to make it through a day of normal childhood activities, nor participate in sports, nor even bike a few blocks to school without experiencing pain at the spot of the vaccination that makes her have to stop all activity for at least a day before she can walk again.",,,,Y,,,,Y,N,01/27/2015,01/27/2015,0,,PVT,PVT,,NO,NONE,,

The author discussed about the fatal allergic reaction due to influenza vaccine. This report refers to a 42-month-old female patient. Past drug history included acetylsalicylic acid and the patient experienced hives for one day during the first year of life which were thought to follow medication. There was no history of asthma and no family history indicative of allergy could be elicited. Prior to the injection of the vaccine the physician had attempted to obtain a history of allergy to eggs or chicken with negative results. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient was vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) subcutaneously at a dose of 0.5 ml on an unknown date. The patient complained of pains in the abdomen and chills followed by vomiting and convulsions four hours after the vaccination. On examination the patient had a rectal temperature of 109 F. The patient was hospitalized within two hours after the onset of symptoms. On admission to the hospital the patient showed pronounced cyanosis, pupils were widely dilated and unresponsive to light. The lungs showed moist rales over both pulmonary fields and the heart rate was 180 per minute. The abdomen was not distended. The extremities showed convulsive contractions during examination. During the seven hour stay in the hospital the patient became increasingly cyanotic despite oxygen and epinephrine hydrochloride therapy. It was noted that bleeding was pronounced at the sites of hypodermic puncture for the administration of medicaments and that large areas of ecchymosis developed around the injected sites. Slight bleeding was also noted from the vaginal and oral orifices. Convulsions occurred at one to two minute intervals. The convulsions ceased after about five hours and the temperature fell to 103 F. The heart rate increased in rapidity up to 240 per minute but remained regular. The respirations were noted to be Cheyne-Stokes in type. Two hours after entry to the hospital breathing ceased and artificial respiration was instituted. After the resumption of respiration constant bilateral twitching and spasms were noted. This was most decided in the lower extremities. Five hours after admission and seven hours after the onset of symptoms the patient showed great shock with pronounced collapse of the veins which rendered venipuncture difficult. Thirty minutes before death a surgical exposure of the right ankle vein was considered necessary for intravenous therapy. At that time an attempt was made to administer dextrose and saline solution with 10 per cent calcium gluconate. The patient was becoming more cyanotic and it was difficult to obtain the pulse beat. Artificial respiration was again instituted and after an intracardiac injection of epinephrine hydrochloride the patient was pronounced dead. Blood examination showed 80 per cent hemoglobin, 4.02 million red cells and 44,000 white cells with 36 per cent neutrophils, 61 per cent lymphocytes and 3 per cent eosinophils. The clinical picture of the patient was that of an allergic reaction which developed four hours after the injection and was characterized by convulsions, abdominal pain and vomiting with associated hemorrhagic phenomena., respiratory arrest, hyperthermia and death. The outcome of the event convulsions was recovered and outcome of other events was not reported. The cause of death was ascribed to anaphylactic shock secondary to the injection of influenza vaccine with air embolism as an immediate terminal contributory cause.

On 26th December 2000, the patient received the 2nd dose of DTaP vaccine. On 27th August 2001, the patient received pneumococcal vaccine and varicella vaccine. In December 2000, less than a day after receiving DTaP vaccine, the patient experienced complex febrile convulsion (serious criteria death, hospitalization and GSK medically significant), status epilepticus (serious criteria death and GSK medically significant), epilepsy (serious criteria death and GSK medically significant), injection site swelling, injection site erythema, apnea (serious criteria GSK medically significant), fever, cyanosis, twitching of limbs, Gaze Palsy (serious criteria GSK medically significant), shallow breathing, grunting and otitis media. On 6th February 2001, the patient experienced jerkiness and generalized tonic-clonic seizure (serious criteria GSK medically significant). On 16th November 2007, the patient experienced cardiac arrest (serious criteria death and GSK medically significant) and cough. On 17th November 2007, the patient experienced multi-organ failure (serious criteria death and GSK medically significant). The patient was treated with ATIVAN, ceftriaxone and phenobarbital. On 16th November 2007, the outcome of the complex febrile convulsion was fatal. On 17th November 2007, the outcome of the status epilepticus, epilepsy, cardiac arrest and multi-organ failure were fatal. On an unknown date, the outcome of the injection site swelling, injection site erythema, apnea, fever, cyanosis, twitching of limbs, Gaze Palsy, shallow breathing, grunting, otitis media, jerkiness, generalized tonic-clonic seizure and cough were unknown.

Additional details were provided as follows: The patient was a healthy. On December 26, 2000, the patient received his second dose of the DTaP vaccine. The patient's parents recalled that there was some swelling around the injection site (right upper extremity) and site was red. Early in the morning on 27 December 2000 (within 24 hours of vaccination), the patient's parents found him seizing in his crib and took him to the emergency room. The seizure lasted about 15 minutes and was controlled with medication by the doctors. Five minutes later, the patient began seizing again with apnea and according to the timeline in the medical records, the second seizure was stopped when the patient was given an ATIVAN IV and oxygen. The medical records were unclear, but the second seizure lasted at least a few minutes, and it could have lasted as long as 15 minutes. It was noted that the first seizure was stopped at 4:30 A.M., the second seizure started five minutes later, and the second seizure was stopped at 4:50 A.M. The medical records document the patient's condition on admission and his progression. On admission, the patient was cyanotic and actively seizing. The neurology consult on 27 December 2000, noted that the patient had returned to baseline.

The following is verbatim from the article: Background. Reporting of adverse events (AEs) following vaccination can help identify rare or unexpected complications of immunizations and aid in characterizing potential vaccine safety signals. We developed an open-source, generalizable clinical decision support system called Electronic Support for Public Health-Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (ESP-VAERS) to assist clinicians with AE detection and reporting. Methods. ESP-VAERS monitors patients' electronic health records for new diagnoses, changes in laboratory values and new allergies following vaccinations. When suggestive events are found, ESP-VAERS sends the patient's clinician a secure electronic message with an invitation to affirm or refute the message, add comments, and submit an automated, prepopulated electronic report to VAERS. High-probability AEs are reported automatically if the clinician does not respond. We implemented ESP-VAERS in December 2012 throughout an integrated healthcare system. We queried the VAERS database to determine the healthcare system's baseline reporting rates from January 2009 to March 2012 and then assessed changes in reporting rates with ESP-VAERS. Results. In the 8 months following implementation, 91 622 vaccinations were given. ESP-VAERS sent 1385 messages to responsible clinicians describing potential AEs. Clinicians opened 1304 (94.2 percent) messages, responded to 209 (15.1 percent), and confirmed 16 for transmission to VAERS. An additional 16 high-probability AEs were sent automatically. Reported events included seizure, pleural effusion, and lymphocytopenia. The odds of a VAERS report submission during the implementation period were 30.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.52-95.5) times greater than the odds during the comparable preimplementation period.

Before going, I had heard that yellow fever vaccinations can sometimes cause a few days of flu-like symptoms that typically last no longer than about three days. I was 70 years old at the time and unaware of the information below from the ""Precautions"" section of the CDC website which I found after my reaction. ""Age greater than or equal to 60 years is a precaution for yellow fever vaccination, particularly if this is the first dose of the yellow fever vaccine given. An analysis of adverse events passively reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System from 2000 through 2006 indicates that people aged greater than or equal to 60 years are at increased risk for any serious adverse event after vaccination, compared with younger people. The rate of serious adverse events in people aged greater than or equal to 60 years was 8.3 per 100,000 doses distributed, compared with 4.7 per 100,000 for all vaccine recipients."" I developed my first symptoms on Saturday night, January 16 with chills, fever, night sweats and body aches much worse than with the flu. I rotated between TYLENOL and Ibuprofen for the fever and pain and felt better on Monday. However, my fever started climbing on Tuesday and by Wednesday evening I was seriously ill. I saw my local doctor first thing the next morning (Thursday, January 21) and was admitted to the local hospital. I was given IV's for dehydration, TYLENOL for fever, Tramadol for pain, and something for nausea. My doctor also gave me ROCEPHIN by IV to try to keep me from getting pneumonia while unable to be up and out of bed. I became so weak that I could hardly do anything and eating just seemed to take more effort than it was worth plus I had no appetite. Any activity or noise in the room exhausted me even if it was just other people talking. I asked that I have no visitors. I was really sensitive to noise and light and lay for hours awake but with my eyes closed. After three nights in the hospital, my fever was not going as high and I was beginning to try to eat so the doctor sent me home on Sunday afternoon, January 31. By late Tuesday, February 2, my temperature was coming back up and my doctor was out of town so my wife and I went to the emergency room (about 80 miles from home and one of the closest major medical facilities in our area). Having no definitive test and no effective treatment for the yellow fever, the emergency room doctor just started doing tests to figure out what else might be wrong. He thought he heard something in my lungs and ordered an X-ray. That is when they discovered that I had pneumonia. They admitted me to the hospital and assigned me to a hospitalist. After a couple of nights in the hospital, they did another chest X-ray and said that the pneumonia was in both lower lobes of my lungs and worse than originally thought. Dr. said that it did not show up clearly on my X-ray when admitted due to dehydration. He also asked if I was eating, which I was starting to do, and told me that I was borderline malnourished when I first entered the hospital. While I as in hospital, Dr. rotated antibiotics by IV for the pneumonia in addition to giving another one by mouth at night. He gave me TYLENOL for the fever and something for pain. Even though I was still having fever every day, Dr. discharged me after six nights in the hospital and sent me home with a prescription for an antibiotic to be taken for 10 days after discharge. Even after finishing my antibiotic at home, my temperature still rose above normal every day. I made a follow-up visit to my family doctor on February 11, shortly after finishing my antibiotic at home. A chest X-ray showed my lungs to be clear and my blood work was good. There was nothing to do but live with the fever (and take TYLENOL for it), keep hydrated and rest. My temperature continued to come up every day until February 23.

Methods. ESP-VAERS monitors patients' electronic health records for new diagnoses, changes in laboratory values and new allergies following vaccinations. When suggestive events are found, ESP-VAERS sends the patient's clinician a secure electronic message with an invitation to affirm or refute the message, add comments, and submit an automated, prepopulated electronic report to VAERS. High-probability AEs are reported automatically if the clinician does not respond. We implemented ESP-VAERS in December 2012 throughout an integrated healthcare system. We queried the VAERS database to determine the healthcare system's baseline reporting rates from January 2009 to March 2012 and then assessed changes in reporting rates with ESP-VAERS. Results. In the 8 months following implementation, 91 622 vaccinations were given. ESP-VAERS sent 1385 messages to responsible clinicians describing potential AEs. Clinicians opened 1304 (94.2 percent) messages, responded to 209 (15.1 percent), and confirmed 16 for transmission to VAERS. An additional 16 high-probability AEs were sent automatically. Reported events included seizure, pleural effusion, and lymphocytopenia. The odds of a VAERS report submission during the implementation period were 30.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 9.52-95.5) times greater than the odds during the comparable preimplementation period. Conclusions. An open-source, electronic health record-based clinical decision support system can increase AE detection and reporting rates in VAERS. This case involves a patient (age and gender not reported), who was vaccinated with a dose of HIB (Manufacturer: unknown), a dose of DTAP-HEPATITIS B-IPV (Manufacturer: other), a dose of PCV13 (Manufacturer: other) and a dose of Rotavirus (Manufacturer: other) (batch number, route, dose in series and site of administration were not reported) on unspecified date.

The patient had medical history of bronchial asthma and there was no history of drug allergy. Her medications included montelukast, salbutamol and SERETIDE. She denied use of any other medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and herbal medications. There was no history of diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis or blood transfusion. She denied smoking, alcohol or intravenous drug use. She was referred to the emergency room (ER) by her primary medical doctor (PMD) for evaluation of elevated serum creatinine level (10.3 mg/ dL). The patient was seen by her PMD one day before her ER visit for evaluation of worsening bilateral lower extremity edema. She had received the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine two weeks before her ER presentation. The patient developed fever, intermittent nausea and vomiting and lower extremity edema soon after being immunized with the influenza vaccine. She had refused influenza vaccination in the past as her father died from GB syndrome after receiving influenza vaccine. Review of systems was negative for sore throat, dyspnea, gross hematuria, arthralgias or rash. On physical examination, her blood pressure was elevated at 220/100 mm Hg and there was 3+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. She was afebrile in the ER. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. At the time of ER presentation, the serum creatinine was elevated at 9.93 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen was 77 mg/dL. The serum creatinine checked three months before presentation to the ER was 0.9 mg/dL. The serum total protein was 7.8 g/dL and serum albumin was low (2.3 g/dL). Because of the high globulin fraction, serum immunofixation was performed, which revealed polyclonal gammopathy but no monoclonal immunoglobulin was seen. Repeat laboratory testing performed subsequently revealed a total protein level of 4.5 g/dL and serum albumin of 2.2 g/dL. Aspartate aminotransferase was mildly elevated (49 U/L). Other liver enzymes were within normal limits. Complete blood count was normal. Urinalysis was significant for 20-30 WBC/hpf, 10-20 RBC/hpf and 3+ proteinuria. Her random urine total protein to creatinine (TP/CR) ratio was significantly elevated at 22. A 24-h urine collection revealed 20.5 g of protein. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis in the ER revealed no hydronephrosis or peri-nephric inflammatory changes. Chest X-ray was normal. Workup for secondary causes of the NS and AKI revealed non-reactive hepatitis C virus antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen. The antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), cryoglobulins, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody were all negative. The serum complement levels were normal. A CT scan-guided kidney biopsy was subsequently performed. Kidney biopsy findings: Eight glomeruli were identified on light microscopic examination of the kidney biopsy specimen. The glomeruli showed patent capillary loops and urinary spaces. The interstitium showed patchy edema and mild to moderate inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of mononuclear cells with many eosinophils. The arteries showed mild intimal sclerosis without vasculitis. Immunofluorescence showed scattered fine granular staining for IgG, C3, kappa and lambda light chains in the outer aspect of the glomerular capillary wall. Electron microscopy showed scattered electron dense deposits in the subepithelial and intramembranous locations. Extensive effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes was seen. The kidney biopsy findings were consistent with (stage 1) MN and AIN.

The authors report a cluster of cases of IPD (invasive pneumococcal disease) in previously healthy vaccinated children. After observing a cluster of IPD cases among children hospitalized at the authors' hospital queried the institution's database for children under the age of 18 years who presented during 2014 with positive blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or pleural fluid cultures. The authors abstracted demographic, clinical, and microbiological information including pneumococcal serotypes from the medical records. The institutional Review Board approved the study. Five previously healthy children without identifiable comorbidities or suspected immunodeficiencies were diagnosed with IPD between 26Oct2014 and 19Nov2014 based on culture results. Their cultures were forwarded to the hospital for subsequent serotyping. The average age of patients within this cluster was 3.64 years (0.62-5.58 years). Three patients were male. Four children had previously received appropriate immunizations with PCV-13. Three children were found to have serotype 19A (one of whole was unvaccinated, secondary to parental decision) and one child was found to have serotype 4. Both 19A and 4 were included in the PCV-13. The fifth child had serotype 17F, which was not included in PCV-13. S. pneumoniae was isolated from peripheral blood cultures in all cases. Four children presented with pneumonia, confirmed by consolidation on chest X-ray, and one presented with a unilateral infection involving the skin around the eye (preseptal cellulitis). All five pneumococcal isolates were susceptible to beta-lactams and macrolides. Children with bacteremic pneumonia were treated initially with either ampicillin (n=2) for 1-2 days, followed by amoxicillin for a total course of treatment of 10-14 days, respectively, or ceftriaxone (n=2, one of whom had a non-anaphylactic allergy to penicillin), for 1-2 days, followed by amoxicillin or cefpodoxime for 10-14 days, respectively. The patient with preseptal cellulitis received one dose of ampicillin/sulbactam followed with standard dose amoxicillin/clavulanate for 10 days. The patients recovered without complications, except for one child with serotype 4 pneumococcal pneumonia. This child developed empyema after discharge, but was successfully treated with video-assisted thoracoscopy and amoxicillin therapy. The authors report a cluster of IPD among five previously healthy children who presented in 2014. Four of these children had been appropriately vaccinated with PCV-13, therefore these cases represent breakthrough pneumococcal infections. Only one of these patients had a serotype that was not covered by the vaccine. This case refers to a child patient of an unspecified age, ethnicity and gender who received PCV-13 (unknown manufacturer) via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date, at single dose. The patient experienced breakthrough pneumococcal infection, serotype 17F on an unspecified date with outcome of recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included susceptibility test: susceptible to beta-lactams and macrolides, peripheral blood culture which detected S. pneumoniae, serotyping: serotype 17F and chest X-ray.

She had recurrent abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, light-headedness, off and on low grade fevers, etc. I took her back to her pediatrician several times, but he didn't do anything except flu and strep cultures in December and February 1. Then she complained of joint pain as we were leaving his office on February 1. By the time we got home, she couldn't walk and had purpura all over her legs. I called the pediatrician back and he said it was an allergic reaction and to give her Benadryl. I did but it got worse. I sent them pictures and told them it was blood under the skin, they argued with me over the phone. I hung up and took her to an urgent care. They called an ambulance because they were afraid it was meningitis. The ER diagnosed her with HSP. She had complications and we returned to the ER two days later, then more complications led to us taking her to another ER on 2/8/16. She stayed for 7 days.

Co-suspect products included ADVAIR Diskus inhalation powder for asthma and emphysema. The patient's past medical history included pneumonia. Concurrent medical conditions included arthralgia multiple (airplane flying accident), emphysema (taking ADVAIR) and asthma (taking ADVAIR). Concomitant products included amlodipine, FLONASE, SINGULAIR, NAPROSYN, PROAIR HFA, Aspirin (Baby) and prednisone. In October 2015, the patient received influenza vaccine (intramuscular). In April 2001, the patient started ADVAIR Diskus (inhaled) 1 puff(s) once daily. In October 2015, an unknown time after receiving influenza vaccine and ADVAIR Diskus, the patient experienced underdose. In November 2015, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant), influenza, shivering, difficulty breathing, weight loss, unable to eat, tiredness, diarrhea and vomiting. ADVAIR Diskus was continued with no change. On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure and underdose were unknown and the outcome of the influenza, shivering, difficulty breathing, weight loss, unable to eat, diarrhea and vomiting were recovered/resolved and the outcome of the tiredness was not recovered/not resolved. The reporter considered the vaccination failure, influenza, shivering, difficulty breathing, weight loss, unable to eat, tiredness, diarrhea and vomiting to be unrelated to influenza vaccine. The reporter considered the influenza, shivering, difficulty breathing, weight loss, unable to eat, tiredness, diarrhea and vomiting to be unrelated to ADVAIR Diskus. Additional details were received as follows: This case was received from the consumer via the vaccine patient assistance program (GlaxoSmithKline Access). In October 2015, the patient received Flu vaccine (unknown manufacturer). In November 2015 (approximately 30 days after vaccination) and December 2015, the patient experienced the flu, with multiple symptoms. Underdose was also reported as an event, it was not clear whether it corresponded to ADVAIR or Flu vaccine and the exact reason for underdose was also not provided. The patient planned to continue follow-up with his physician on an unknown date. The patient believed that the ADVAIR and flu shot (unknown manufacturer) had nothing to do with him experiencing the flu, including the multiple symptoms as listed above. The patient was transferred from GlaxoSmithKline Access.
